      "question": "The Rudder controls which movement of an aircraft?",
      "options": ["pitch", "yaw", "roll", "turn"],
      "answer": "B",
      "brief": "The rudder controls the aircraft's yaw movement, which turns the nose left or right around the vertical axis. Yaw helps an aircraft keep its nose pointed in the right direction and prevents unwanted sideways movement.",
      "detailed": "The rudder is a vertical control surface located on the tail of the aircraft. When the pilot moves the rudder left or right using pedals, the nose of the plane moves side-to-side, a motion called 'yaw.' This keeps the aircraft aligned correctly during coordinated turns, crosswinds, and taxiing. While roll and pitch are managed by ailerons and elevators, the rudder specifically controls the rotation around the vertical axis. In multi-engine planes, the rudder helps counteract yaw caused by engine failure. Proper rudder use improves control, reduces drag in flight maneuvers, and is vital for safe handling, especially on takeoff and landing. Its primary purpose in flight is not to turn the aircraft, but to control and correct any unwanted yaw, ensuring the plane stays stable and on course."

      "question": "What is the definition of an aeroplane’s angle of attack?",
      "options": [
        "The angle between the direction of flight and longitudinal axis",
        "The angle between the longitudinal axis and the horizontal plane",
        "The angle between the lateral axis and horizontal plane",
        "The angle between the relative airflow and the chordline"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "brief": "Angle of attack is the angle between the chordline of the wing and the direction of the relative airflow. This measurement is crucial for understanding lift and stall characteristics.",
      "detailed": "The chordline is a straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of an aircraft’s wing. The relative airflow is the direction of air moving over the wing as the aircraft flies. The angle formed between these two—chordline and airflow—is called the angle of attack. This is a critical aerodynamic variable because it directly affects the lift generated by the wing. Increasing the angle of attack increases lift, but only up to a certain point; beyond a critical angle, airflow separates causing a stall. Adjusting the angle of attack allows pilots to control climb, descent, and turns safely. It's not defined by the aircraft’s path, orientation, or other axes, but specifically by the position of the wing regarding incoming airflow, making answer D correct."

      "question": "A constant speed propeller is a propeller which",
      "options": [
        "rotates at a constant speed by altering the blade angle",
        "is most efficient at a constant aircraft speed",
        "rotates at a constant speed by varying angle of attack",
        "maintains a constant aircraft speed by altering blade angle"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "brief": "A constant speed propeller automatically changes its blade angle so that the propeller continues spinning at the selected speed, regardless of changes in engine power or aircraft speed.",
      "detailed": "Constant speed propellers work by varying the pitch of the blades through a hydraulic or electric governor. When extra power is needed or a change in flight speed occurs, the blades’ angle is changed—flattened for takeoff/climb, steepened for cruise—so the rotational speed (RPM) remains constant. This improves efficiency, power output, and reduces engine wear. Pilots set the desired RPM with the propeller control; the system automatically changes the blade angle to maintain that RPM, regardless of throttle setting or airspeed. This is different from fixed-pitch propellers, which lack this adaptability. Thus, answer A is correct because it directly reflects how the blade angle is managed to hold a constant rotational speed."

      "question": "As fuel is consumed during level flight cruise at high altitude, which of the following factors is correct?",
      "options": [
        "the angle of attack must be increased",
        "the stalling speed will increase",
        "the Centre of Pressure will move forward",
        "induced drag will decrease"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "brief": "As fuel is used up, the weight of the aircraft decreases. This reduces the amount of lift needed and therefore the induced drag becomes lesser.",
      "detailed": "Induced drag is the drag caused by generating lift, and it is closely related to the aircraft’s weight. As an aircraft cruises at high altitude and burns fuel, its overall mass is reduced. With less weight, less lift is needed, so the angle of attack can stay the same or even decrease slightly. This reduction in required lift leads to lower induced drag, making the aircraft more aerodynamically efficient and possibly consuming less fuel. Other options are incorrect: stall speed slightly decreases with lower weight; centre of pressure movement depends on lift distribution, not fuel burn; and angle of attack need not increase unless compensating for another factor. Thus, answer D correctly identifies the decreasing induced drag."

      "question": "By what percentage does the lift increase in a steady level turn at 45˚ angle of bank compared to straight and level flight?",
      "options": ["41%", "19%", "31%", "52%"],
      "answer": "A",
      "brief": "Lift must increase by 41% in a 45˚ banked turn to maintain altitude. This counteracts the added load caused by banking.",
      "detailed": "When an aircraft banks to make a turn, part of the lift force tilts horizontally to create the centripetal force for turning. To keep altitude, the total lift produced must rise above straight-and-level flight. In a 45˚ bank, the load factor becomes 1.41 (from 1/cos(45˚)), so lift must be increased by 41%. Pilots achieve this by pulling back on the controls to slightly increase the angle of attack and/or airspeed. This principle is key for understanding turn dynamics and safe maneuvers, as insufficient lift could result in a descent or stall. Calculating this percentage involves basic trigonometry and converting the load factor into percentage increase, confirming answer A is correct."

      "question": "During spin recovery, which of the following is correct?",
      "options": [
        "the ailerons are held in the neutral position",
        "the control stick is moved sideways, in the direction of the spin",
        "the control stick is moved sideways, against the direction of the spin",
        "the control stick is pulled fully back"
      ],
      "answer": "A",
      "brief": "Ailerons should be neutral during spin recovery to avoid worsening the spin. Rudder and elevator inputs are used for controlled recovery.",
      "detailed": "In a spin, asymmetric lift and drag make the aircraft rotate steeply around its yaw axis. To recover safely, standard procedure calls for ailerons to be neutral. Deflecting ailerons in either direction can deepen or prolong the spin. Proper recovery generally involves applying opposite rudder to stop the rotation and moving the elevator to break the stall. Once rotation stops and airflow returns to normal over surfaces, gentle back pressure is added to begin a smooth pullout from the dive. This process is well-defined in pilot training syllabi, and neutral ailerons are stressed as a vital safety principle. Thus, answer A is correct: neutral ailerons support a safe spin recovery sequence."

      "question": "For a normally stable aeroplane, where is the Centre of Gravity located?",
      "options": [
        "aft of the neutral point",
        "with a sufficient minimum margin ahead of the neutral point of the aeroplane",
        "at the neutral point of the aeroplane",
        "between the aft limit and the neutral point of the aeroplane"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "brief": "The correct location is ahead of the neutral point by a safe margin. This ensures normal stability and control in flight.",
      "detailed": "The centre of gravity (CG) is the point where an aircraft balances in all directions. For safe and stable flight, CG must always be forward of the neutral point—the position where aerodynamic forces balance and stability is lost. If CG moves behind the neutral point, the aircraft becomes unstable and may be difficult or impossible to control. A minimum margin is maintained for safety, set by manufacturers and verified during loading. Pilots check weight and balance calculations to confirm CG stays ahead of this critical point. This design keeps handling predictable, prevents stalls and spins, and ensures passenger and pilot safety. Thus, answer B is correct by standard aviation principles."

      "question": "How can an aircraft’s tendency to Dutch Roll be reduced?",
      "options": [
        "reducing the size of the fin",
        "giving the wings anhedral",
        "sweeping the wings",
        "increasing longitudinal dihedral"
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "brief": "Giving the wings anhedral (downward angle) reduces Dutch Roll, a side-to-side and up-and-down oscillation, especially in swept-wing jets.",
      "detailed": "Dutch Roll is a complex oscillation involving both yaw and roll, common in swept-wing aircraft. It results from weaker directional stability and relatively stronger lateral (roll) stability. To counteract Dutch Roll, designers use several approaches, including anhedral wings. Anhedral (downward wing slope) reduces the roll stability, balancing the mismatch with yaw stability, and dampens oscillations. Increasing the size of the fin or using yaw dampers improves directional stability, but anhedral more directly addresses the stability ratio. Sweeping wings and dihedral can affect roll/yaw dynamics, but may not adequately resolve Dutch Roll. Answer B is the design choice that consistently reduces Dutch Roll tendency, especially in large jetliners and military aircraft."
